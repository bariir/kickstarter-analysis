# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to help Louise uncover most successful month to launch her campaign. Based on the data findings Louise can target specific market to launch her campaign and use specific category such as threater play. Below is the overall report.

## Data Preparation
We have sorted, filtered and added conditional formatting to help Louise target specific country, and specific category and subcategory of interest. 

## Averages, Account and Sums
We have calculated Averages donations, percentage funded. We calculated number successful, failed, canceled Category and Subcategory outcomes. 

## Measures:
We used different measures including measures of central tendency (mean, median and mode) which simplifies and translates a lot of information about the distribution of a dataset down to one number. Range to find the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value of the data set. Variance which allows you to identify how far data points are from the mean or center
