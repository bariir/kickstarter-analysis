# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this Kickstarter analysis, I have provided two deliverables including Theater Outcomes by Launch Date and Outcomes based on goals. The analysis includes visualization metrics that will enables Louise to get deeper understanding of outcomes based on launch date and outcomes based on goal. 

### Purpose
The goal of this project is to provide Louise an analysis of her play Fever which fall short of her expected campaign goal amount. Also, Louise would like to compare different campaigns in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals so that she can adjust her launch dates and funding goals to get better outcome. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The challenge I faced in this task was related to formatting the line chart which I was able to solve quickly by referring to previous examples in the module material.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I have faced couple of challenges during this analysis. First one was related to using the COUNTIFS () function correctly because was not providing enough arguments based on expected criteria such as filtering the outcome based on whether it is successful, failed, or cancelled.  I overcame this challenge by referring to the module material examples, and external resource found through google search. 

The second challenge was related to Outcomes Based on Goals. I was selecting all columns and rows in order to create the visualization Line chart for the Goal and Number of Percentages (Percentage Successful, Percentage Failed, and Percentage Canceled). By referring to the module material and the sample chart, I was able to figure it out and only select such fields as Goal, Percentage Successful, Percentage Failed, and Percentage that created the right Outcomes Based on Goal line chart.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I have not faced other challegens besides the ones I mentioned above. I was able to resolve these issues by either refering to the module material or using google search to find additional resources.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    The two conclusions that can be drawn from the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date are following.
    1)	Most successful campaigns launch dates are on May, June and July during the year. 
    2)	Failed or canceled projects are early in the year or towards end of the year like November and December.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    Almost 80% of the successful goals have an amount that is less than $1000 which suggests that the higher you set your goals the less successful it may become. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    Some of the limitations about the dataset is it is not large sample data to represent true comes. Also, it is not focused on specific market, say US or UK.  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    We can create Pivot Table based on Outcomes by Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals. Also, we can create stacked chart and bar chart.
